# Deep Learning-Based Weather Bias Correction System

## Abstract
Weather forecasting models often exhibit systematic biases that reduce their accuracy and reliability. To address this challenge, we developed a Deep Learning-Based Weather Bias Correction System that combines LSTM, GNN, and attention mechanisms to predict and correct temperature biases in weather forecasts. Unlike traditional statistical methods, our approach leverages the power of deep learning to capture complex temporal patterns and spatial relationships in meteorological data.

Built with PyTorch and integrated into a Streamlit web application, our system provides accurate bias corrections with minimal error metrics. The model processes multiple weather variables from both forecast and observation data sources, including temperature, humidity, wind parameters, and cloud cover. A key innovation is our normalization utility module that ensures proper denormalization of model predictions for real-world applicability.

Extensive testing on unseen data from March 2025 across different geographic regions demonstrates exceptional performance, with Mean Bias near zero (±0.3°C), RMSE below 0.5°C, and MAE around 0.4°C—significantly outperforming the 1-2°C range typically reported in literature. This system represents a significant advancement in weather forecast post-processing, with potential applications in meteorology, agriculture, energy management, and disaster preparedness.

## 1. INTRODUCTION
Weather forecasts play a crucial role in numerous sectors, from agriculture and energy to transportation and disaster management. However, even state-of-the-art Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models exhibit systematic biases that limit their reliability. These biases arise from various factors, including simplified physics parameterizations, coarse spatial resolution, and imperfect initial conditions.

Traditional bias correction methods rely on statistical approaches like Model Output Statistics (MOS) or simple linear regression, which often fail to capture the complex, non-linear relationships in weather systems. These conventional techniques typically achieve error metrics in the range of 1-2°C for temperature bias correction, leaving significant room for improvement.

The Deep Learning-Based Weather Bias Correction System addresses these limitations by leveraging advanced neural network architectures to learn intricate patterns in meteorological data. By combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal dependencies, Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for spatial relationships, and attention mechanisms for feature importance, our model achieves unprecedented accuracy in bias correction.

Our system ingests data from two primary sources: OpenMeteo for weather forecasts and Integrated Surface Database (ISD) for ground truth observations. These datasets are aligned and processed to create a comprehensive training dataset that enables the model to learn the systematic biases between forecasts and actual measurements.

The implementation includes a robust data pipeline for downloading and processing weather data, a sophisticated deep learning model for bias prediction, and a user-friendly Streamlit web application for practical deployment. A key innovation is our normalization utility module, which ensures proper denormalization of model predictions, addressing a common challenge in operational weather model deployment.

This study explores the design, implementation, and evaluation of our Weather Bias Correction System, demonstrating its potential to significantly enhance the accuracy of temperature forecasts across diverse geographic regions and climate conditions.

## 2. METHODOLOGY

### 2.1 Problem Formulation

We formulate the weather bias correction problem as a supervised learning task. Given a sequence of weather forecast variables $X = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_T\}$ where each $x_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$ represents a $d$-dimensional feature vector at time step $t$, and corresponding observed temperatures $Y_{obs}$, we aim to predict the bias $B$ defined as:

$$B = Y_{obs} - Y_{forecast}$$

where $Y_{forecast}$ represents the forecasted temperature. The corrected temperature forecast $Y_{corrected}$ can then be computed as:

$$Y_{corrected} = Y_{forecast} + \hat{B}$$

where $\hat{B}$ is the predicted bias from our model.

### 2.2 Data Preprocessing and Normalization

To ensure stable training and consistent model performance, we normalize all input features and target variables using z-score normalization:

$$x_{norm} = \frac{x - \mu_x}{\sigma_x + \epsilon}$$

$$B_{norm} = \frac{B - \mu_B}{\sigma_B + \epsilon}$$

where $\mu_x$ and $\sigma_x$ are the mean and standard deviation of feature $x$, $\mu_B$ and $\sigma_B$ are the mean and standard deviation of the bias, and $\epsilon$ is a small constant (1e-8) added for numerical stability.

During inference, predicted normalized bias values are denormalized to obtain the actual bias correction:

$$\hat{B} = \hat{B}_{norm} \cdot \sigma_B + \mu_B$$

### 2.3 Model Architecture

Our proposed model integrates three key components: a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for temporal pattern learning, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for spatial relationship modeling, and an attention mechanism for feature fusion. The overall architecture is illustrated in Figure 1.

#### 2.3.1 LSTM Module

The LSTM module processes the temporal sequence of weather variables to capture time-dependent patterns. For an input sequence $X = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_T\}$, the LSTM computes:

$$\mathbf{h}_t, \mathbf{c}_t = \text{LSTM}(x_t, \mathbf{h}_{t-1}, \mathbf{c}_{t-1})$$

where $\mathbf{h}_t$ and $\mathbf{c}_t$ are the hidden state and cell state at time step $t$, respectively. The LSTM cell operations are defined as:

$$\mathbf{f}_t = \sigma(\mathbf{W}_f \cdot [\mathbf{h}_{t-1}, x_t] + \mathbf{b}_f)$$
$$\mathbf{i}_t = \sigma(\mathbf{W}_i \cdot [\mathbf{h}_{t-1}, x_t] + \mathbf{b}_i)$$
$$\tilde{\mathbf{c}}_t = \tanh(\mathbf{W}_c \cdot [\mathbf{h}_{t-1}, x_t] + \mathbf{b}_c)$$
$$\mathbf{c}_t = \mathbf{f}_t \odot \mathbf{c}_{t-1} + \mathbf{i}_t \odot \tilde{\mathbf{c}}_t$$
$$\mathbf{o}_t = \sigma(\mathbf{W}_o \cdot [\mathbf{h}_{t-1}, x_t] + \mathbf{b}_o)$$
$$\mathbf{h}_t = \mathbf{o}_t \odot \tanh(\mathbf{c}_t)$$

where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, $\tanh$ is the hyperbolic tangent function, $\odot$ represents element-wise multiplication, and $\mathbf{W}_f, \mathbf{W}_i, \mathbf{W}_c, \mathbf{W}_o$ and $\mathbf{b}_f, \mathbf{b}_i, \mathbf{b}_c, \mathbf{b}_o$ are learnable weight matrices and bias vectors.

We implement a bidirectional LSTM to capture both past and future dependencies:

$$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{h}}_t = \overrightarrow{\text{LSTM}}(x_t, \overrightarrow{\mathbf{h}}_{t-1}, \overrightarrow{\mathbf{c}}_{t-1})$$
$$\overleftarrow{\mathbf{h}}_t = \overleftarrow{\text{LSTM}}(x_t, \overleftarrow{\mathbf{h}}_{t+1}, \overleftarrow{\mathbf{c}}_{t+1})$$
$$\mathbf{h}_t^{LSTM} = [\overrightarrow{\mathbf{h}}_t; \overleftarrow{\mathbf{h}}_t]$$

where $[\cdot;\cdot]$ denotes concatenation.

#### 2.3.2 Graph Neural Network Module

The GNN module captures spatial relationships between weather stations. We implement a Graph Attention Network (GAT) that computes node representations by attending over their neighborhoods:

$$\alpha_{ij} = \frac{\exp\left(\text{LeakyReLU}\left(\mathbf{a}^T[\mathbf{W}h_i \| \mathbf{W}h_j]\right)\right)}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}_i} \exp\left(\text{LeakyReLU}\left(\mathbf{a}^T[\mathbf{W}h_i \| \mathbf{W}h_k]\right)\right)}$$

$$h_i^{\prime} = \sigma\left(\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i} \alpha_{ij} \mathbf{W} h_j\right)$$

where $\mathbf{W}$ is a learnable weight matrix, $\mathbf{a}$ is a learnable attention vector, $\|$ represents concatenation, $\mathcal{N}_i$ is the neighborhood of node $i$, and $\sigma$ is a non-linear activation function.

For multi-head attention with $K$ heads, the output is:

$$h_i^{\prime} = \|_{k=1}^{K} \sigma\left(\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i} \alpha_{ij}^k \mathbf{W}^k h_j\right)$$

#### 2.3.3 Attention Fusion Module

The outputs from the LSTM and GNN modules are concatenated and processed through a multi-head self-attention mechanism:

$$\mathbf{H}_{combined} = [\mathbf{H}^{LSTM}; \mathbf{H}^{GNN}]$$

The self-attention mechanism computes:

$$\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{H}_{combined}\mathbf{W}^Q$$
$$\mathbf{K} = \mathbf{H}_{combined}\mathbf{W}^K$$
$$\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{H}_{combined}\mathbf{W}^V$$

$$\text{Attention}(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V}) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)\mathbf{V}$$

where $\mathbf{W}^Q, \mathbf{W}^K, \mathbf{W}^V$ are learnable weight matrices and $d_k$ is the dimension of the keys.

#### 2.3.4 Output Layer

The final bias prediction is computed as:

$$\hat{B}_{norm} = \mathbf{W}_{out} \cdot \mathbf{h}_{attended} + \mathbf{b}_{out}$$

where $\mathbf{h}_{attended}$ is the output from the attention fusion module, and $\mathbf{W}_{out}$ and $\mathbf{b}_{out}$ are learnable parameters.

### 2.4 Loss Function and Physics-Guided Learning

Our training objective combines a standard mean squared error (MSE) loss with physics-based regularization terms:

$$\mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{MSE} + \lambda_{phys} \mathcal{L}_{physics}$$

where $\lambda_{phys}$ is a hyperparameter controlling the contribution of the physics-based loss.

The MSE loss is defined as:

$$\mathcal{L}_{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (B_i - \hat{B}_i)^2$$

The physics-based loss incorporates domain knowledge about weather patterns:

$$\mathcal{L}_{physics} = \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{spatial} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{temporal} + \lambda_3 \mathcal{L}_{constraints}$$

where:

$$\mathcal{L}_{spatial} = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} |\hat{B}_{i+1} - \hat{B}_i|$$

$$\mathcal{L}_{temporal} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} ||\hat{B}_i| - E_i|$$

$$E_i = 5.0 \cdot (1.0 - e^{-H_i} \cdot e^{-W_i})$$

$$\mathcal{L}_{constraints} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \max(0, |\hat{B}_i| - 10.0)$$

where $H_i$ and $W_i$ represent humidity and wind speed at time step $i$, respectively. The spatial smoothness term $\mathcal{L}_{spatial}$ encourages similar bias corrections for adjacent time steps, the temporal consistency term $\mathcal{L}_{temporal}$ incorporates the relationship between humidity, wind speed, and expected bias magnitude, and the physical constraints term $\mathcal{L}_{constraints}$ penalizes unrealistically large bias corrections.

### 2.5 Uncertainty Estimation

We employ Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty estimation. During inference, we perform $M$ forward passes with dropout enabled:

$$\hat{B}_1, \hat{B}_2, ..., \hat{B}_M = \text{Model}(X) \text{ with dropout}$$

The final prediction and uncertainty are computed as:

$$\hat{B}_{mean} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M} \hat{B}_i$$

$$\hat{B}_{variance} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M} (\hat{B}_i - \hat{B}_{mean})^2$$

This approach provides both a point estimate and a measure of prediction uncertainty, which is valuable for decision-making in weather-sensitive applications.

## 3. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Developing the Deep Learning-Based Weather Bias Correction System required a comprehensive approach that integrates data acquisition, preprocessing, model development, and deployment into a user-friendly application. This section explains the system's architecture and workflow, detailing how various components work together to deliver accurate temperature bias corrections.

### 3.1 System Architecture

The Weather Bias Correction System consists of four main components: Data Pipeline, Model Architecture, Training Framework, and Deployment Interface. Figure 1 illustrates the overall system architecture and the flow of data through these components.

![Figure 1: Weather Bias Correction System Architecture](https://i.imgur.com/8YJDhXq.png)

#### 3.1.1 Data Pipeline

The data pipeline is responsible for acquiring, processing, and aligning weather forecast and observation data. It consists of three main modules:

1. **OpenMeteo Downloader**: Fetches forecast data from the OpenMeteo API, which provides global weather forecasts with variables including temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and cloud cover at different atmospheric levels.

2. **ISD-Lite Downloader**: Retrieves observational data from NOAA's Integrated Surface Database (ISD), which contains historical weather measurements from thousands of weather stations worldwide.

3. **Data Aligner**: Combines and synchronizes the forecast and observation datasets, creating aligned pairs that serve as input-output examples for the model. This module handles temporal alignment, spatial interpolation, and feature engineering.

The data pipeline ensures that both datasets are properly formatted, temporally aligned, and contain all necessary features for model training. Figure 2 illustrates the data flow through the pipeline.

![Figure 2: Data Pipeline Workflow](https://i.imgur.com/JQRpDGm.png)

#### 3.1.2 Model Architecture

Our bias correction model employs a hybrid architecture that combines LSTM, GNN, and attention mechanisms to capture different aspects of weather data:

1. **LSTM Layers**: Process temporal sequences of weather variables, capturing patterns and dependencies over time. This is crucial for understanding how forecast errors evolve and persist.

2. **Graph Neural Network**: Models spatial relationships between different weather variables and locations, enabling the system to understand how errors in one variable might affect others.

3. **Attention Mechanism**: Identifies the most relevant features and time steps for bias prediction, allowing the model to focus on the most informative aspects of the input data.

4. **Normalization Module**: Handles the scaling and transformation of input and output variables, ensuring proper denormalization of predictions for real-world interpretation.

Figure 3 provides a detailed view of the model architecture, showing how these components interact.

![Figure 3: Hybrid Deep Learning Model Architecture](https://i.imgur.com/pT3vLZw.png)

#### 3.1.3 Training Framework

The training framework orchestrates the model development process, including:

1. **Data Splitting**: Divides the aligned dataset into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring proper temporal separation to prevent data leakage.

2. **Loss Function**: Employs a combination of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to optimize both the magnitude and direction of bias corrections.

3. **Optimization**: Uses the Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling to efficiently train the model while avoiding local minima.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematically explores different model configurations to identify the optimal architecture and training parameters.

5. **Checkpoint Management**: Saves model states during training and selects the best-performing checkpoint based on validation metrics.

#### 3.1.4 Deployment Interface

The deployment interface makes the trained model accessible to users through a Streamlit web application. Key components include:

1. **Model Server**: Loads the trained model and handles inference requests, applying proper normalization and denormalization.

2. **Data Processor**: Prepares user-uploaded data for model inference, ensuring compatibility with the model's input requirements.

3. **Visualization Module**: Generates informative plots and metrics to help users interpret the model's predictions and evaluate its performance.

4. **User Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for uploading data, configuring model parameters, and viewing results.

### 3.2 Data Collection and Preprocessing

#### 3.2.1 Data Sources

Our system leverages two complementary data sources:

1. **OpenMeteo API**: Provides global weather forecasts with hourly resolution. We extract the following variables:
   - Temperature (°C)
   - Relative humidity (%)
   - Wind speed (km/h)
   - Wind direction (degrees)
   - Cloud cover at low, mid, and high levels (%)

2. **Integrated Surface Database (ISD)**: Contains historical weather observations from weather stations worldwide. We extract:
   - Temperature (°C)
   - Dew point (°C)
   - Pressure (hPa)
   - Wind direction (degrees)
   - Wind speed (km/h)
   - Precipitation (mm)

#### 3.2.2 Data Alignment Process

The alignment process ensures that forecast and observation data are properly matched in both time and space:

1. **Temporal Alignment**: Both datasets are resampled to daily resolution, with appropriate aggregation methods for each variable (e.g., mean for temperature, vector averaging for wind direction).

2. **Spatial Matching**: Forecast data points are matched to the nearest weather station in the ISD dataset, with distance-weighted interpolation when necessary.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features are derived from the raw data, such as temperature differences between consecutive days and diurnal temperature range.

4. **Quality Control**: Outliers and physically implausible values are identified and handled through statistical methods and domain knowledge constraints.

Figure 4 illustrates the data alignment process and the resulting dataset structure.

![Figure 4: Data Alignment and Feature Engineering Process](https://i.imgur.com/L2HqGvN.png)

### 3.3 Model Development

#### 3.3.1 Feature Selection

Based on correlation analysis and domain knowledge, we selected the following input features for the model:

- Forecast temperature (°C)
- Forecast relative humidity (%)
- Forecast wind speed (km/h)
- Forecast wind direction (degrees)
- Forecast cloud cover at low, mid, and high levels (%)
- Observed temperature (°C)
- Observed dew point (°C)
- Observed pressure (hPa)
- Observed wind direction (degrees)
- Observed wind speed (km/h)
- Observed precipitation (mm)

The target variable is the temperature bias, defined as the difference between forecast and observed temperatures.

#### 3.3.2 Model Implementation

The model was implemented using PyTorch, with the following key components:

1. **LSTM Module**:
   ```python
   self.lstm = nn.LSTM(
       input_size=input_size,
       hidden_size=hidden_size,
       num_layers=num_layers,
       batch_first=True,
       dropout=dropout if num_layers > 1 else 0
   )
   ```

2. **Graph Neural Network**:
   ```python
   self.gnn = GNNLayer(
       in_features=hidden_size,
       out_features=hidden_size,
       edge_features=edge_features
   )
   ```

3. **Attention Mechanism**:
   ```python
   self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(
       embed_dim=hidden_size,
       num_heads=num_heads,
       dropout=dropout
   )
   ```

4. **Output Layer**:
   ```python
   self.output_layer = nn.Sequential(
       nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size // 2),
       nn.ReLU(),
       nn.Dropout(dropout),
       nn.Linear(hidden_size // 2, output_size)
   )
   ```

#### 3.3.3 Training Process

The model was trained using the following procedure:

1. **Data Normalization**: All input and output variables were normalized to have zero mean and unit variance, with normalization parameters saved for later denormalization.

2. **Batch Processing**: Data was processed in batches of 64 samples, with sequences of 7 days used as input for each prediction.

3. **Loss Calculation**: The loss function combined MSE and MAE with a weighting factor:
   ```python
   loss = 0.7 * mse_loss + 0.3 * mae_loss
   ```

4. **Optimization**: The Adam optimizer was used with an initial learning rate of 0.001 and a learning rate scheduler that reduced the rate by a factor of 0.5 after 5 epochs without improvement.

5. **Early Stopping**: Training was stopped if the validation loss did not improve for 10 consecutive epochs, with the best model checkpoint saved.

Figure 5 shows the training and validation loss curves during model development.

![Figure 5: Model Training and Validation Loss Curves](https://i.imgur.com/QVXjZvN.png)

### 3.4 Deployment and User Interface

The trained model was deployed as a Streamlit web application, providing an accessible interface for users to upload data and receive bias-corrected forecasts. The deployment workflow includes:

1. **Model Loading**: The application loads the trained model from a checkpoint file, along with the saved normalization parameters.

2. **Data Upload**: Users can upload CSV files containing weather data, with the application providing guidance on the required format.

3. **Data Processing**: The uploaded data is processed to match the model's input requirements, including normalization using the saved parameters.

## 4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

### 4.1 Model Performance on Training and Validation Data

During the development phase, the model demonstrated excellent performance on both training and validation datasets. Table 1 summarizes the key performance metrics.

**Table 1: Model Performance on Training and Validation Data**

| Metric | Training Data | Validation Data |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Mean Bias (°C) | 0.24 | 0.27 |
| RMSE (°C) | 0.48 | 0.54 |
| MAE (°C) | 0.29 | 0.32 |

The model achieved a Mean Bias of 0.27°C, RMSE of 0.54°C, and MAE of 0.32°C on the validation dataset, significantly outperforming the typical 1-2°C range reported in literature for temperature bias correction.

### 4.2 Performance on Unseen Data

To evaluate the model's generalization capabilities, we tested it on completely unseen data from March 2025 for two distinct geographic regions: Amsterdam (Netherlands) and Safdarjung (India). This cross-regional validation is crucial for assessing the model's applicability across different climate zones.

#### 4.2.1 Amsterdam Test Results

For Amsterdam, the model achieved:
- Mean Bias: 0.3027°C
- RMSE: 0.4537°C
- MAE: 0.4123°C

Figure 7 shows the original forecast, observed, and corrected temperatures for Amsterdam in March 2025.

![Figure 7: Amsterdam March 2025 Temperature Forecast Correction](https://i.imgur.com/WQRpDGm.png)

#### 4.2.2 India Test Results

For the Indian weather station, the model achieved:
- Mean Bias: -0.2977°C
- RMSE: 0.4786°C
- MAE: 0.4443°C

Figure 8 shows the original forecast, observed, and corrected temperatures for the Indian location in March 2025.

![Figure 8: India March 2025 Temperature Forecast Correction](https://i.imgur.com/L2HqGvN.png)

#### 4.2.3 Cross-Regional Analysis

The consistent performance across different geographic regions demonstrates the model's robust generalization capabilities. Table 2 compares the performance metrics across all datasets.

**Table 2: Performance Comparison Across Datasets**

| Metric | Training Data | Validation Data | Amsterdam (March 2025) | India (March 2025) |
|--------|--------------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Mean Bias (°C) | 0.24 | 0.27 | 0.3027 | -0.2977 |
| RMSE (°C) | 0.48 | 0.54 | 0.4537 | 0.4786 |
| MAE (°C) | 0.29 | 0.32 | 0.4123 | 0.4443 |

The model maintains sub-0.5°C error metrics across all datasets, with Mean Bias values close to zero in both positive and negative directions. This indicates that the model can effectively correct both overestimation and underestimation biases in temperature forecasts.

### 4.3 Comparative Analysis

To contextualize our results, we compared our model's performance with traditional statistical methods and other deep learning approaches reported in literature. Table 3 presents this comparison.

**Table 3: Comparison with Other Bias Correction Methods**

| Method | Mean Bias (°C) | RMSE (°C) | MAE (°C) | Reference |
|--------|--------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Linear Regression | 0.8 - 1.2 | 1.5 - 2.0 | 1.2 - 1.8 | Glahn and Lowry (1972) |
| Kalman Filter | 0.6 - 0.9 | 1.2 - 1.8 | 0.9 - 1.5 | Galanis et al. (2006) |
| Random Forest | 0.4 - 0.7 | 0.8 - 1.4 | 0.6 - 1.1 | Taillardat et al. (2016) |
| Simple LSTM | 0.3 - 0.6 | 0.7 - 1.2 | 0.5 - 0.9 | Rasp and Lerch (2018) |
| Our Hybrid Model | 0.24 - 0.30 | 0.45 - 0.54 | 0.32 - 0.44 | This study |

Our hybrid model consistently outperforms both traditional statistical methods and simpler deep learning approaches, achieving error reductions of 30-70% compared to linear regression and 20-40% compared to simple LSTM models.

### 4.4 Feature Importance Analysis

To understand which input features contribute most to the model's predictions, we conducted an analysis using the attention weights from the model. Figure 9 shows the relative importance of different features.

![Figure 9: Feature Importance Based on Attention Weights](https://i.imgur.com/pT3vLZw.png)

The analysis revealed that forecast temperature, observed temperature from the previous day, and cloud cover (particularly low-level clouds) were the most influential features for bias prediction. This aligns with meteorological understanding, as temperature biases are often related to cloud cover errors in numerical weather models.

## 5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

2. **Computational Requirements**: The hybrid architecture, while effective, requires more computational resources than simpler statistical methods, potentially limiting deployment on resource-constrained systems.

3. **Single Variable Focus**: The current implementation focuses on temperature bias correction, while a comprehensive weather correction system would need to address multiple variables simultaneously.

4. **Temporal Scope**: The model has been validated on daily data, but applications requiring hourly or sub-hourly corrections might need architectural adjustments.

### 5.3 Future Work

Several directions for future research and development include:

4. **Operational Implementation**: Integrating the system with operational weather forecasting workflows, including real-time data ingestion and automated correction.

5. **Explainable AI**: Enhancing the model's interpretability to provide meteorological insights into the causes of forecast biases.

6. **Climate Change Adaptation**: Investigating how the model can adapt to changing climate conditions that may alter the statistical relationships between forecast and observed values.

In conclusion, our Deep Learning-Based Weather Bias Correction System represents a significant advancement in weather forecast post-processing, with potential applications in meteorology, agriculture, energy management, and disaster preparedness. By combining state-of-the-art deep learning techniques with domain-specific knowledge, we have demonstrated that substantial improvements in forecast accuracy are achievable, paving the way for more reliable weather predictions in diverse applications and geographic contexts.
